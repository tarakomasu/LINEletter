# State Management Decision for Line Letter Editor

**Date:** 2025-10-14

## 1. Context

This document outlines the decision-making process for choosing a state management strategy during the refactoring of the Line Letter desktop editor (`src/app/pages/line-letter-desktop`).

The primary goal of the refactoring is to resolve the issue of a large, monolithic component (`editor/page.tsx`) by separating concerns. A key architectural decision is how to manage shared state (e.g., Fabric.js canvas instance, selected objects, page data) across newly created smaller components.

## 2. Options Considered

Two primary approaches were evaluated:

1.  **React Context API with `useReducer`:** Using React's built-in state management capabilities.
2.  **Redux with Redux Toolkit:** Implementing a dedicated, external state management library.

## 3. Comparison

The evaluation was based on several factors relevant to this specific project.

| Criteria | React Context API (+ `useReducer`) | Redux (+ Redux Toolkit) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dependencies** | ✅ **None.** Built into React. | ❌ **External.** Adds new dependencies (`@reduxjs/toolkit`, `react-redux`). |
| **Learning Curve** | ✅ **Low.** Familiar concepts for React developers. | ⚠️ **Medium.** Requires understanding of Redux principles (store, slices, thunks). |
| **Performance** | ⚠️ **Good (with care).** Can cause unnecessary re-renders if not implemented carefully. Requires patterns like context splitting to optimize. | ✅ **Excellent.** `useSelector` provides highly optimized, granular subscriptions to state changes out-of-the-box. |
| **DevTools** | ⚠️ **Basic.** React DevTools offer some visibility. | ✅ **Excellent.** Redux DevTools enable powerful features like time-travel debugging. |
| **Handling Non-Serializable Data** | ✅ **Excellent.** Can directly store complex objects like the `fabric.js` canvas instance. | ❌ **Poor.** Storing non-serializable data is strongly discouraged and complicates the architecture. Requires workarounds. |

## 4. Decision and Justification

**Decision:** We will adopt the **React Context API with the `useReducer` hook** for managing the editor's state.

**Justification:**

1.  **Compatibility with Fabric.js:** The ability to easily and directly store the non-serializable `fabric.js` canvas instance in the state is the most critical factor. React Context handles this naturally, whereas Redux would require complex and awkward workarounds that negate its benefits.
2.  **Localized State:** The editor's state is complex but confined to a single feature. A global state management library like Redux is overkill for this use case.
3.  **Maintainability & Simplicity:** By avoiding external libraries and their associated boilerplate, we keep the architecture simpler and more aligned with standard React patterns.
4.  **Manageable Performance:** The potential performance drawbacks of Context can be effectively mitigated by applying standard optimization patterns (e.g., separating state and dispatch contexts), making it a suitable choice for this application's scale.

This approach provides the best balance of power, simplicity, and architectural cleanliness for the specific needs of the Line Letter editor.
